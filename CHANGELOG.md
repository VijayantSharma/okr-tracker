### Removed

- Form for migrating data from Google Sheets

### Fixed

- Fix JSDoc errors in `db.js`

## [1.1.0] - 2020-03-09

This release introduces _dynamic date periods_ that replace static annual quarters for objectives. This means that custom date periods need to be manually created on each department and product onwards.

Under the ‘Danger Zone’ section on the admin view there is an action that automates the convertion of currently existing objecties onto dyamic date periods. This should only be triggered **once** in production after release of this version to prevent data loss.

This change adds a `/periods` subcollection on the `departments` and `products` collections that holds the details for the periods as well as the _progression_ for that period.

### Added

- Show callout to team members when a product image is missing
- Documentation for managing departments on Help page
- Automated backup of the firebase database
- Automated restore of backup for the firebase database

### Changed

- Converting static annual quarters to dynamic and custom date periods
  - Users can now create unlimited future (and past) periods
  - Users must give name date periods
  - Navigating between periods using URL query parameters
  - Adjustments in Cloud Functions to handle progression for dynamic periods
- Refactoring some Firestore handling – introducing the `serializeList` function to make the codebase a bit more DRY.
- Hide progress visualisation when department or product does not have any objectives

### Removed

- Legacy dashboard component

### Fixed

- Fix issue where progress graphic did not always update when navigating between pages
- Force the submenu to appear even when no periods are available
- Minor layout adjustment on the page header (less white space below page name on desktop)
- Allow floating point numbers as key result progress
- Replace _ninjas_ with _cubes_ when a department has zero products
